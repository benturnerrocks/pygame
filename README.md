### pygame

This is an attempt to create multiple video games using pygame package in python.

## The first game is SNAKE

# RULES:
The player controls a constantly moving block snake and tries to navigate a constricted square grid. 

To gain points, the player must eat the blue fish. However, as the player eats fish, the snake gets longer and thus hard to navigate within the grid. If the player runs into the wall, they are reset back to length 1 and score 0. The snake also cannot run over its own tail or else the game resets. If a player eats a red fish, bad things might happen or really good things.

The goal is to get the highest score possible... good luck!

Note: turn on sound


## The second game is SUDOKU (under construction)

# RULES:
Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square.
